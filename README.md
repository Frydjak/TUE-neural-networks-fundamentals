# Fundamentals-of-Neural-Networks
This project is part of the 5LSH0 - Computer Vision AI and 3D Data Analysis course at TU Eindhoven. It focuses on the fundamentals of neural networks, with emphasis on implementing them "from scratch", without using any widely aviable machione learning libraries.

## Dataset
The project is based on the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
