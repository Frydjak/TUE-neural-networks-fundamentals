# Fundamentals-of-Neural-Networks

This project is part of the 5LSH0 - Computer Vision AI and 3D Data Analysis course at TU Eindhoven. It focuses on the fundamentals of neural networks, with an emphasis on implementing a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to classify digits from the MNIST dataset. You will work with fully-connected layers, activation functions (ReLU and Sigmoid), and mini-batch SGD with cross-entropy loss. The project also involves analyzing the modelâ€™s performance, calculating trainable parameters, and experimenting with different loss functions such as Cross-Entropy, Dice, and Focal Loss to enhance accuracy.
