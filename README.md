# Neural Networks Fundamentals

This project is part of the 5LSH0 - Computer Vision AI and 3D Data Analysis course at TU Eindhoven. It focuses on the fundamentals of neural networks, with emphasis on implementing them "from scratch", without using any widely aviable machione learning libraries.

## Dataset
The project is based on the [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset is widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

### Gradient descent (GD)
to be completed
### Mini batch gradient descent (MBGD)
to be completed
### Pytorch Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
to be completed


## Running the code
### Environment Setup
It is recommended to use the course-provided "experiments_JF" environment to run the code.

### Dataset Download
The Datasets folder contains a zipped file of the MNIST dataset. This dataset includes all samples without any division into training, testing, or validation sets. To run the code, please unzip the file manually.

## Remarks
- No model saving or loading functionality has been implemented in this project. As a result, training is required for each program execution.
